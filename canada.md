**History Note:** Public Mobile stopped proving IP Relay Services and recommended get Telus.  

**Super Important Note:** All of IP Relay services are running by one company called [viiz Communications](https://viiz.com/) **There are no actual competitors!** Also, they provied their stock and custom-brand  apps for IP relay service on iOS and Android device but they are poorly optimized on modern phone and tablet and not following system-wide accessibility (size and screen reader) and modern standard design.
