**Note:** Fido and Rogers are using same service on [iprelayservice.net](https://iprelayservice.net/login/#/) and they did not re-brand it.

**Super Important Note:** All of IP Relay services are running by one company called [viiz Communications](https://viiz.com/) **There are no actual competitors!** Also, they provied their [stock and custom-brand apps for IP relay service](https://apps.apple.com/ca/developer/viiz-communications-canada-inc/id1411486002?see-all=i-phonei-pad-apps) on iOS and Android device but they are poorly optimized on modern phone and tablet and not following system-wide accessibility (size and screen reader) and modern standard design.
